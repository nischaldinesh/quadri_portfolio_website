      "Existing guidelines for categorical color selection are heuristic, often grounded in intuition rather than empirical studies of readers‚Äô abilities. While design conventions recommend palettes maximize hue differences, more recent exploratory findings indicate other factors, such as lightness, may play a role in effective categorical palette design. We conducted a crowdsourced experiment on mean value judgments in multi-class scatterplots using five color palette families‚Äîsingle-hue sequential, multihue sequential, perceptually-uniform multi-hue sequential, diverging, and multi-hue categorical‚Äîthat differ in how they manipulate hue and lightness. Participants estimated relative mean positions in scatterplots containing 2 to 10 categories using 20 colormaps. Our results confirm heuristic guidance that hue-based categorical palettes are most effective. However, they also provide additional evidence that scalable categorical encoding relies on more than hue variance.",

    abstract:
      "Visual clustering is a common perceptual task in scatterplots that supports diverse analytics tasks (e.g., cluster identification). However, even with the same scatterplot, the ways of perceiving clusters (i.e., conducting visual clustering) can differ due to the differences among individuals and ambiguous cluster boundaries. Although such perceptual variability casts doubt on the reliability of data analysis based on visual clustering, we lack a systematic way to efficiently assess this variability. In this research, we study perceptual variability in conducting visual clustering, which we call Cluster Ambiguity. To this end, we introduce CLAMS, a data-driven visual quality measure for automatically predicting cluster ambiguity in monochrome scatterplots. We first conduct a qualitative study to identify key factors that affect the visual separation of clusters (e.g., proximity or size difference between clusters). Based on study findings, we deploy a regression module that estimates the human-judged separability of two clusters. Then, CLAMS predicts cluster ambiguity by analyzing the aggregated results of all pairwise separability between clusters that are generated by the module. CLAMS outperforms widely-used clustering techniques in predicting ground truth cluster ambiguity. Meanwhile, CLAMS exhibits performance on par with human annotators. We conclude our work by presenting two applications for optimizing and benchmarking data mining techniques using CLAMS",
